    <h6>About Me</h6>

    <p>Hi, I'm Katelyn Parsons â€“ a junior user experience specialist and junior graphic designer who is passionate about creating memorable customer experiences, and making an impact through digital design and web development.  

 

        As a recent graduate from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology with a diploma in Interactive Design, I am excited to enter the industry with a fresh perspective and am eager to gain valuable experience that will help me grow as a professional. My aspirations are to be involved in projects that make a lasting impact in various specialties within the design, tech, film, and sports and entertainment industry.  
        
         
        
        When I'm not working I spend much of my time hiking, experimenting with my photography, building digital prints, and training my dog.  </p>
